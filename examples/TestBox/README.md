GlassLab SDK Example js (Browser)
=========================

This browser-compatible GlassLab SDK example allows the caller to call various functions in the API and see their output on the browser page.  This allows the caller to see how these functions should work inside of a sandbox environment.

For the example to run successfully, the following should be true:

1) The glasslab-sdk.js and glasslab-sdk.css files should be in the path.
2) The example files must be hosted somewhere and not just run locally
3) The URL must be whitelisted with GlassLab.  Please contact GlassLab to get a developer account and for us to white list your server.
